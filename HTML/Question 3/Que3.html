    <h1>Nature Of Birds</h1>


    <hr>

    <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves ,characterised<br>by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs,a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart,<br>and a strong yet lightweight skeleton.Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in)<br> bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are over 11,000 living species, more than half <br>of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according <br>to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings,<br>which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led<br>to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species.<br>The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species <br>of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.<br>The study of birds is called ornithology.</p>

    <h2>Nature Of Animals</h2>

    <hr>

    <p>Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia.<break> With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development.</p>
