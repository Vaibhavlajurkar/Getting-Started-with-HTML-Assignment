The Document Type Declaration, commonly referred to as the "DOCTYPE," is an important declaration in HTML that specifies the version of HTML or XML being used in a document. It helps browsers to interpret and render the document correctly. The DOCTYPE declaration is placed at the very beginning of an HTML document.the browser that the document is written in HTML5. The DOCTYPE declaration is not an HTML tag; it's a directive to the browser about the version of HTML being used. Different versions of HTML have different rules and specifications, so providing the correct DOCTYPE helps ensure proper rendering and interpretation of the document by browsers.
